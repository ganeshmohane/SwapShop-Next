    <strong>Welcome to <a href="login_page.php">SwapShop</a> - the student-to-student platform for buying and selling books and study materials!</strong>
    <br><br>
    <p> As a student, we know how expensive it can be to purchase textbooks and study materials.SwapShop was created with you in mind, to provide a convenient and affordable solution to exchange study materials with your peers. Our platform allows you to save money and access the resources you need to succeed.

Getting started with SwapShop is easy. First, create an account using your email address. Once you have an account, you can browse and post listings on the platform.

When you're ready to find study materials, browse through all the listings posted by other students. You can search for specific textbooks or materials using the search bar, or filter by category, price, or location.

If you have textbooks or study materials that you no longer need, you can easily post a listing to sell them. Simply provide a description, price, and photos (if available) to help other students find what they're looking for.

If you find something you want to buy, you can claim the product. If you're interested in an item but want to negotiate the price, you can also make an offer to the seller.

By buying and selling with other students on SwapShop, you'll be able to save money and connect with your peers in a meaningful way. We hope you find SwapShop to be a helpful resource for your studies.
